***Hello, My name is Aaron Regala
 and I'm the one who created
 this very simple program*****

===Reminders before running the code
 to prevent unwanterd errors===


************
 Dim con As New OleDb.OleDbConnection
("Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=E:\EmploymentFiles\dbStudentsGradeCrud.accdb")

1) The provider of OleDb is Microsoft Access, local database
you need to change the source depending on the location of database file
you can access the code and see this part on the first part.

2) After running the app, please click the "Refresh Record" Button to fetch or check all records.

3) it is a simple Create, Update, Delete program (CRUD)
-NO data validation and authentication  is implendented.

4) Simple VB. Net (frame works) created in Visual Studio Preview 2019
